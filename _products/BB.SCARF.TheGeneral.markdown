### Product development / Circular Knitting

This product is directly developed on the circular knitting machine with BYBORRE signature knitting technique. At BYBORRE we program and handle the machines ourselves.


### Product finishing

After running the circular knitting files the textiles will checked one by one at our quality control and steamed by hand. We finish the scarfs in-house in Amsterdam. And we guarantee the more you use it the softer and nicer the product will become.
