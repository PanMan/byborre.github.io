### Yarn sourcing

At BYBORRE we hand select the best yarns to get the best quality.

* Front + Back - double treaded Bio-cotton from Italy
* Filling yarn - special BB filling Polyester that will get more volume the more it is used

### Product development / Circular Knitting

This product is directly developed on the circular knitting machine with BYBORRE signature knitting technique. At BYBORRE we program and handle the machines ourselves.


### Product finishing

After running the circular knitting files the textiles will checked one by one at our quality control and steamed by hand. We finish the scarfs in-house in Amsterdam. And we guarantee the more you use it the softer and nicer the product will become.
