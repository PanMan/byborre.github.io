   <h2>About ByBorre</h2>

    <p class="intro">Creating textiles that can sense.</p>

    <p>Fabrics feel natural. They are all around us and most of the time you don’t even notice them. People have been using fabrics in two ways for a very long time. To express their identity and to protect themselves from the outside world. We want to stretch those capabilities. BYBORRE is where technology meets textile. Seamlessly integrated with everyday life. Embedded in the things you already enjoy wearing or interacting with around you.</p>

    <p>BYBORRE makes textile with embedded technology. Enabling a new way of digital interaction. Human to human.</p>

    <p>The BYBORRE label creates products made from the fabrics developed at the BB:LAB. Our goal is to create a new platform for digital interaction with standardised sensor components in our textile development kit called BB:TEX. We will make textile programmable and enable partners to create their own products and applications.</p>
