BYBORRE took the costume design of the Future Relic short for their account. It is the third project of artist Daniel Arsham, consisting of a series of nine short films. “The series depicts a future civilisation at various points before and after a major ecological change on Earth. In the world of Future Relic, nature as we know it today does not exist.”
