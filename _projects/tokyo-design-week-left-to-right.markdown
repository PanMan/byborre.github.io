At the Tokyo Design Week BYBORRE brought the production process to the exposition of BaToMa. During the timespan of the
LEFT TO RIGHT installation BYBORRE turned the ‘Raw’ materials - as framed blankets - into finished jackets and scarfs.
As a visitor you got the possibility to influence the continuing of the expo by partaking in the process with BYBORRE.
