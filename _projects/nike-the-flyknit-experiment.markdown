BYBORRE designed and produced a lasting invitation to the flyknit experience event in the NIKE dome.
NIKE released the Lunar Flyknit 1+ summer shoe in wintertime. BYBORRE came up with a scarf, in line of the no waist mind set of the Flyknit. The graphics of the scarf are inspired on the Flyknit and is executed in the BYBORRE 3D signature knit.
