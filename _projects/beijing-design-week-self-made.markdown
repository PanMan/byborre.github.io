Together with students and locals of Dashilar, workshops were held with the aim of breaking down the cultural differences by working together. Through this bridging of cultures new design disciplines emerge.

BYBORRE was invited to come to Beijing to lead one of the workshops. With a suitcase filled with self-developed textiles, BYBORRE left to work on a collection there. Looking at how the locals work with materials and textiles in particular, BYBORRE began to collect materials to combine these with his own textile. By assembling and the renewal of these existing materials and techniques new perspective is reached, bringing craft and technology to a next level, a new value.
