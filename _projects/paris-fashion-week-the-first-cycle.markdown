The First Cycle is the story from the yarn to the show. The fashion show started with a visualisation of a creative
production process in stop-motion animation. The production process is something you hardly get to see in fashion and
for BYBORRE that is at least as important as the final pieces.

In the credits of the show it was important for BYBORRE to thank also the circular knitting machine:

„Dear Circular knitting machine,

I’m Grateful that I had the opportunity
to work with you, to play with you,
to learn from you and create with you.

I hope that if you could talk you would
tell me you enjoyed it too…

BYBORRE”
