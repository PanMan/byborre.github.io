SOMERSAULT was held in one of Amsterdamâ€™s oldest sports domes, the Apollohal, where the show was all about
movement. The garments were especially made for, with and tailored on the gymnasts of the Dutch national team. These sportsmen demonstrated the comfortable, fitted outfits while performing gymnastics.
